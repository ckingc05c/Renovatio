# Renovatio

Renovatio is a progression-based Minecraft mod that enhances gameplay by introducing a stage-based difficulty system, new equipment, and more powerful "Ominous" versions of bosses. The mod aims to provide a challenging and rewarding experience for players who are looking for a fresh take on Minecraft's progression.

## Features

*   **Stage-Based Difficulty:** The world's difficulty progresses through stages, with mobs becoming more powerful as the stage increases.
*   **New Equipment:** A wide range of new tools, weapons, and armor to help you face the increasing challenges.
*   **Ominous Bosses:** Vanilla bosses like the Wither and Ender Dragon can spawn as "Ominous" variants with enhanced abilities and stats.
*   **Custom Crafting:** New crafting stations and recipes to create the mod's unique equipment.

## Setup

To build the mod from the source, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd renovatio`
3.  Build the mod using Gradle: `./gradlew build`

The compiled `.jar` file will be located in the `build/libs/` directory.

## Usage

The mod's progression is tied to a "stage" system, which affects the difficulty of mobs and the availability of certain equipment. You can use the following command to interact with the stage system:

*   `/stage get`: Displays the current stage.
*   `/stage set <stage>`: Sets the current stage to the specified value. (Requires operator privileges)

As you progress through the stages, you will encounter more challenging enemies, but you will also gain access to more powerful gear to help you on your journey. Good luck!
